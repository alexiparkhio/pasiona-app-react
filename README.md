# Pasiona React App
This is fullstack App I built for Pasiona. I would like to thank to the company beforehand for the interest they deposited in my skills.

The app simply features a basic CRUD structure with cards. You can display them with a title and a description.

## Installation

Do not forget to install all dependencies on each directory that provides a `package.json` file, and then run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Please notice that the API needs `MongoDB` server to be listening before running. Ensure that `MongoDB` is downloaded and running at `localhost:27017`.

## Project Initialization

### Server-side
For the server, located at `server`, simply run on the root directory:

```sh
$ npm run start
or
$ npm run watch
```

### Client-side
For the client, located at `client`, simply run on the root directory:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Finally, be sure to create your `.env` files based on the `.env.sample` for the env variables.
